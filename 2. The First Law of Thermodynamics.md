# First Law
- States that energy is conserved in nature. ("Energy can't be created and it can't be destroyed")
- Can't be proven mathematically.
- Introduces 3 corollaries.

>[!note]- **Definition** of the First Law 
>When a system undergoes a thermodynamic *cycle*, sum of the *net heat supplied* to the system from it's surroundings and the *net work input* to the system from its surroundings *must be zero*.
>
>$$\Sigma Q\ +\ \Sigma W\ =\ 0$$

> The final answer to a question shouldn't contain a sign, instead there should be a clear indication on weather energy is transferred to the system or from the system

### Corollary 1
>[!note]- **Definition**
> There exists a property of a closed system such that a change in its value is equal to the *sum of the net heat and work transfer* during any change of state.
> 
> $$\Sigma \ (\ Q\ +\ W\ )\ =\ \Delta X$$

>[!note]- **Proof** 
>Consider the thermodynamic cycles below

>>Assume the converse of the corollary 1 is true.
>>$\sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_A\ \neq \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_B$

>>Apply first law to cycles AC and BC
>>$\sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{AC}}\ =\ \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{BC}\ =\ 0$
>>$\sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{A}}\ +\ \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{C}\ =\ \sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{B}}\ +\ \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{C}$
>>$\sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{A}}\ =\ \sum (\ Q\ +\ W\ )_{B}$
>>The assumption is wrong

>> Hence
>> $$\sum {(\ Q\ +\ W\ )\ =$$
