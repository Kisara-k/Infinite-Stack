# First Law
- States that energy is conserved in nature. ("Energy can't be created and it can't be destroyed")
- Can't be proven mathematically.
- Introduces 3 corollaries.

>[!note]- **Definition** of the First Law 
>When a system undergoes a thermodynamic *cycle*, sum of the *net heat supplied* to the system from it's surroundings and the *net work input* to the system from its surroundings *must be zero*.
>
>$$\Sigma Q\ +\ \Sigma W\ =\ 0$$

> The final answer to a question shouldn't contain a sign, instead there should be a clear indication on weather energy is transferred to the system or from the system

### Corollary 1
>[!note]- **Definition**
> There exists a property of a closed system such that a change in its value is equal to the sum of the net heat and work transfer during any change of state.

> $$\Sigma \$$
