# Ideal Gasses
<br>

>[!abstract] Characteristics of Ideal Gases
>- No intermolecular forces
>- Occupies no space (massless & point like particles)
>- Perform perfectly elastic collisions 
>- Has pure random motion (real gases has `Brownian` motion)

>[!warning]- Real gasses with smaller sizes demonstrate *Ideal gas* behavior at **high temperature** & **low pressure**
>>[!tip] How !
>>- At higher temperatures the intermolecular forces become negligible compared to its' total internal energy
>>- At low pressure the volume of the gas molecules become negligible compared to the gas volume.

>[!note] Characteristic Equation
>#### $$\frac{P\ V}{T}\ =\ k$$
> P - pressure
> V - Volume
> T - Absolute temperature

> For a given mas of `m` , 
>> $k\ =\ m\ R$
>> $\therefore \ P\ V\ =\ m\ R\ T$
