>[!abstract] Characteristics of Ideal Gases
>- No intermolecular forces
>- Occupies no space (massless & point like particles)
>- Perform perfectly elastic collisions 
>- Has pure random motion (real gases has `Brownian` motion)

>[!warning]- Real gasses with smaller sizes demonstrate ideal gas behavior at high temperature & low pressure
>>[!tip]- How !
>>- At higher temperatures gas molecules mo
