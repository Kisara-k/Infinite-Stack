# Ideal Gasses
<br>

>[!abstract] Characteristics of Ideal Gases
>- No intermolecular forces
>- Occupies no space (massless & point like particles)
>- Perform perfectly elastic collisions 
>- Has pure random motion (real gases has `Brownian` motion)

>[!warning]- Real gasses with smaller sizes demonstrate *Ideal gas* behavior at **high temperature** & **low pressure**
>>[!tip] How !
>>- At higher temperatures the intermolecular forces become negligible compared to its' total internal energy
>>- At low pressure the volume of the gas molecules become negligible compared to the gas volume.

>[!note] Characteristic Equation
> $\frac{PV}{T} = k$
