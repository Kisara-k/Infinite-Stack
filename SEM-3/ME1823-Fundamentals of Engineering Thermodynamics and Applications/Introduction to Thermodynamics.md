# Ideal Gasses
<br>

>[!abstract]- Characteristics of Ideal Gases
>- No intermolecular forces
>- Occupies no space (massless & point like particles)
>- Perform perfectly elastic collisions 
>- Has pure random motion (real gases has `Brownian` motion)

>[!warning]- Real gasses with smaller sizes demonstrate *Ideal gas* behavior at **high temperature** & **low pressure**
>>[!tip] How !
>>- At higher temperatures the intermolecular forces become negligible compared to its' total internal energy
>>- At low pressure the volume of the gas molecules become negligible compared to the gas volume.

>[!note]- Characteristic Equation
> $$\frac{P\ V}{T}\ =\ k$$
> P - pressure
> V - Volume
> T - Absolute temperature

> For a given mas of `m` , 
>> $\ \ \ \ \ \ k\ =\ m\ R$
>> $\therefore \ P\ V\ =\ m\ R\ T$
>> Where R is `Gas Constant` 
>>
>>For universal gas constant ($R_u$) & molar mass ($M$)
>>##### $R = \frac{R_u}{M}$
>> $$\therefore \ P\ V\ =\ n\ R_u\ T$$

### Specific Heat Capacity
>[!FAQ] What is **Specific Heat Capacity**
> The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of Unit mass of a substance by one degree.
> >[!error] Definition is **valid** only for `reversible` processes.

>[!info]- Heating at **constant volume** & **constant pressure**

>[!note]- **Constant Volume Heat Capacity** ($C_v$)
> Consider a fixed volume of gas is being heated reversibly at constant volume.

>>$\Delta Q - \Delta W = \Delta U$

>>Since boundary work is Zero, $\Delta W = 0$
>>$$\therefore \ \ \Delta Q =\ \Delta U$$

> > For ideal gases when `T=0` , `u=0`  $\ \ \ \therefore$ `k=0`
> > $$\therefore \ \ u\ =\ C_v\ T$$
> This is a property function. 
> Hence it can be used regardless if the process is `reversible` or `irreversible`
