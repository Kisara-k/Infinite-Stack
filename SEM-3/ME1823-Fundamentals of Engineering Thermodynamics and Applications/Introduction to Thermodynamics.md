<br>

>[!abstract] Characteristics of Ideal Gases
>- No intermolecular forces
>- Occupies no space (massless & point like particles)
>- Perform perfectly elastic collisions 
>- Has pure random motion (real gases has `Brownian` motion)

>[!warning]- Real gasses with smaller sizes demonstrate *Ideal gas* behavior at **high temperature** & **low pressure**
>>[!tip] How !
>>- At higher temperatures the intermolecular forces become negligible compared to its' total internal energy
>>- At low pressure the volume of the gas molecules become negligible compared to the gas volume.

>[!note] Characteristic Equation
> $$\frac{P\ V}{T}\ =\ k$$
> P - pressure
> V - Volume
> T - Absolute temperature

>> $\ \ \ \ \ \ k\ =\ m\ R$
>> $\therefore \ P\ V\ =\ m\ R\ T$
>> Where R is `Gas Constant`

>>For universal gas constant ($R_u$) & molar mass ($M$)
>>##### $R = \frac{R_u}{M}$
>> $$\therefore \ P\ V\ =\ n\ R_u\ T$$
