>[!note]- **Thermodynamic Properties**
>- Properties are known as point functions.
>>[!warning] They depend only on the point, not the path followed to reach the state.

>>[!example]- Examples for thermodynamic properties
>>- Pressure                       (intensive)
>>- Volume                        (extensive)
>>- Entropy                        (extensive)
>>- Mass                            (extensive)
>>- Temperature                (intensive)
>>- Enthalpy                      (extensive)
>>- Specific heat capacity (intensive)
>>- Internal energy           (extensive)

>[!FAQ]- What is a **Thermodynamic State**
>- It's an instance of a system defined by properties.
>- Properties are `state variables`

>[!FAQ]- What is **Thermodynamic Equilibrium**
>It's a state of a system that experiences no change.
>>[!abstract] Conditions to satisfy for `Thermodynamic Equilibrium`
>>- Mechanical Equilibrium
>>- Chemical Equilibrium
>>- Phase Equilibrium
>>- Thermal Equilibrium
