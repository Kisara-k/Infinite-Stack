# Energy Balance for Closed Systems
- There is **no** *mass transfer*
- There is **energy transfer** in the form of *heat* or *work*.
- Can be expressed through the *Non - flow energy equation*

>[!note]- Specific Equation
>${Net\ energy\ transferred\ to\ or\ from\ the\ system\ as\ heat\ and\ work\ }\ =\  {\ Net\ increase\ or\ decrease\ in\ the\ total\ energy\ of\ the\ system\ }$
>$Q\ -\ W\ =\ \Delta E$
>$Q\ -\ W\ =\ \Delta U\ +\ \Delta KE\ +\ \Delta PE$

# Energy Balance for Open Systems
- Has both *mass transfer* & *Energy transfer*
