# Pure Substance
- A substance that has a **fixed** *chemical composition* throughout its mass.
- A pure substance doesn't have to be a single element or compound. **Homogeneous mixtures** also qualify as pure substances.
- Ice in water is a pure substance because the chemical composition is the same even if the phases are different.

### Phase of a Pure Substance
- Has solid, liquid & gas states.
- Substance may have several phases within a principal phase.
	- Carbon : graphite or diamond in solid phase.

>[!note]- Fusion Line
>- Also known as the *melting curve* or **solid-liquid phase boundary**.
>- Typically a straight line with a *positive slope*. (melting point increases with pressure for most substances)


>[!note]- Sublimation Line
>**Boundary between solid and gas** regions.
>Represents the transition *from solid* **directly** *to a gas* without passing through the liquid phase.

>[!note]- Evaporation Line
>The **boundary between liquid and gas** regions.
>Represents the pressure and temperature values for transitioning between liquid and gas states.

>[!note]- Triple Point
>The intersection between Fusion, Sublimation and evaporation lines.
>A specific point where solid, liquid and gas phases of a substance coexist in equilibrium.
>Represents the unique temperature and pressure conditions required for the above equilibrium.

>[!note]- Critical Point
