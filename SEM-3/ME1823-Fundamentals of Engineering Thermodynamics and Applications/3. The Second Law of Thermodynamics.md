# Second Law
- Introduces a **directionality** to *heat transfer*.
- Heat doesn't flow from a cooler body to a hotter body on its own.
- **Only** by means of a *work input* will heat flow from a *cooler body* to a *hotter body*

>[!note]- **Kelvin-Plank** Statement of the **Second Law**
>It's **impossible** for any device that operates on a *cycle* to exchange heat with just a *single reservoir* and produce a *net amount of work*.
>
>- This is the reason that the *efficiency* of a *heat engine* **can't** reach a 100%.


### Thermal Reservoir
>[!note]- **Definition**
>A body that can either *absorb* or *supply* heat at *constant temperature*.
>- **Heat Source** : A thermal reservoir that *supply* heat.
>- **Heat Sink** : A thermal reservoir that *absorb* heat.
