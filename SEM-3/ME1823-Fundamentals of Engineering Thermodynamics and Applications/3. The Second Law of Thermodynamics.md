# Second Law
- Introduces a **directionality** to *heat transfer*.
- Heat doesn't flow from a cooler body to a hotter body on its own.
- **Only** by means of a *work input* will heat flow from a *cooler body* to a *hotter body*

>[!note]- **Kelvin-Plank** Statement of the **Second Law**
>It's **impossible** for any device that operates on a *cycle* to exchange heat with just a single [[#Thermal Reservoir]] and produce a *net amount of work*.
>
>- This is the reason that the *efficiency* of a *heat engine* **can't** reach a 100%.
>- For the system to keep doing work a *deliberate heat rejection* **must be** done.

>[!note]- **Carnot** Principle
>The efficiency of a **reversible** *heat engine* operating between 2 thermal reservoirs is *always grater* than the efficiency of an **irreversible** *heat engine* operating between the same thermal reservoirs.

### Thermal Reservoir
>[!note]- **Definition**
>A body that can either *absorb* or *supply* heat at *constant temperature*.
>- **Heat Source** : A thermal reservoir that *supply* heat.
>- **Heat Sink** : A thermal reservoir that *absorb* heat.


### Heat Engine Cycle
>[!example]- Components of a heat engine
>- Boiler  
>- Steam Turbine
>- Condenser
>- Feedwater Pump

>#### Thermal Efficiency $=\ \frac {W_{out}}{Q_{in}}$
>#### $T.E\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ =\ \frac {Q_H\ -\ Q_L}{Q_H}$
>#### $T.E\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ =\ 1\ -\ \frac {Q_L}{Q_H}$
