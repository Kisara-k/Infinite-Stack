### Communication

>[!FAQ]- What is communication
>Sending information from one place to another.

>[!note]- Types of communication 
>Communication can be done using video, text, voice, data & multimedia
>>[!info] Direction of information flow
>>- One way
>>- Interactive - Non real time
>>- Interactive - real time
>
>>[!info] Number of parties involved
>>- Two-party
>>- Multi-party


### Network
>[!FAQ]- What is a Network
>A system that connects devices for communication
>>[!example] Examples for Networks
>> - `PSTN` : Public Switched Telephone Network
>> - `LAN` : Local Area Network
>> - Television Networks
>> - Vehicular Networks
>> - Internet

>[!abstract]- Components of a Network
>- Terminal for Access (ðŸ“±, ðŸ–¥)
>- Equipment for Switching 
>- Media for Transmission 

>[!danger]- Challenges in Networking
>- Different architecture
>- Different languages
>- Different data formats
>- Different communication rates

>[!success]- Solutions
>- Modularization
>- Layering
>- Standardization

<br>

### Layered Architecture
>[!FAQ]- What is Layered Architecture
>Dividing the entire network process into abstract separate functional layers
>

>[!abstract]- Benefits of Layered Architecture
>- Transparent implementation
>- Flexible to modify
>- Independent design and testing ability

>[!example]- Examples for Layered Architecture Models
>- `OSI` reference model
>- `TCP/IP` model


### OSI (Open System Interconnect) Model
>[!note]- Functionality of OSI model
>- Provides communication regardless of the underlying architecture
>- Has 7 layers which have well defined  functions.
>- Boundaries between the layers minimizes the information flow across.
