# Information Representation
- **Bit** : The smallest unit of information a computer can store. (*1 or 0*)
- **Code** : Association of combination of bits with information.

### Common coding standards (ISO, IEEE)

> [!info] ASCII
>A **7-bit code** that assigns a unique combination of bits to English keyboard characters.
>
>> [!image]- ASCII Table
>> ![[Pasted image 20240828155533.png]]

> [!info] Unicode
> Extends ASCII and is **32-bit**, supporting multiple writing systems, scientific symbols, and more.

# Signals
- **Signals**: Used to transmit data via a medium like copper cables, optical fiber, or air.
- Generated by changing the strength of s particular form of energy.

> [!info] Analog
> **Continuously varying** and can take any value between two points at any time.

> [!info] Digital
> Can take **only specific values** and remain at a value for a period before changing.


## Types Of Signals
> [!info] Periodic 
> - Repeat their wave pattern continuously over time.
> - Can be **continuous** or **discrete**.

> [!info] Aperiodic
> - No repeating pattern.
> - Can be continuous or discrete.

## Properties Of Periodic Signals
- **Amplitude**: The strength of the wave at a given time, measured in volts (v), amperes (A), or decibels (dB).
