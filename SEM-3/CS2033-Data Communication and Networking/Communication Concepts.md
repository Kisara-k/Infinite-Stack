# Information Representation
- **Bit** : The smallest unit of information a computer can store. (*1 or 0*)
- **Code** : Association of combination of bits with information.

### Common coding standards (ISO, IEEE)

> [!info] ASCII
>A **7-bit code** that assigns a unique combination of bits to English keyboard characters.
>
>> [!image]- ASCII Table
>> ![[Pasted image 20240828155533.png]]

> [!info] Unicode
> Extends ASCII and is **32-bit**, supporting multiple writing systems, scientific symbols, and more.

# Signals
- **Signals**: Used to transmit data via a medium like copper cables, optical fiber, or air.
- Generated by changing the strength of s particular form of energy.

> [!info] Analog
> **Continuously varying** and can take any value between two points at any time.

> [!info] Digital
> Can take **only specific values** and remain at a value for a period before changing.


## Types Of Signals
> [!info] Periodic 
> - Repeat their wave pattern continuously over time.
> - Can be **continuous** or **discrete**.

> [!info] Aperiodic
> - No repeating pattern.

## Properties Of Periodic Signals

- **Amplitude**: 
	The *strength of the wave* at a given time, measured in volts (v), amperes (A), or decibels (dB).

- **Period (T)**: 
	*Time* between two *consecutive similar points* in the wave; time taken for the pattern to repeat.

- **Frequency (f)**: 
	Number of *oscillations* per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). $f = \frac{1}{T}$​.

- **Phase**: 
	The difference between two waves. Two waves are **in phase** if they *reach corresponding points simultaneously;* otherwise, they are **out of phase**.

- **Wavelength (λ)**: The physical distance between matching points of adjacent cycles of the waveform. It is related to the speed of the signal $(c)$ and frequency $(f)$ by $\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$​.

# Fourier Series
- Any periodic function can be expressed as a sum of sine functions with varying amplitude, frequency, and phase shift. This is critical in **Signal Filtering**.

# Bandwidth 

> [!info] Bandwidth (Analog)
> The range of frequencies a medium can handle, measured in Hertz (Hz).

> [!info] Bandwidth (Digital)
> The maximum number of bits that can be transmitted over a medium.
