>>Characterize fully the data needs of the prospective database users.
>
>>[!info]- Second phase
>>Choosing a data model
>>- Applying the concepts of the chosen data model
>>- Translating these requirements into a conceptual schema of the database
>>- A fully developed conceptual schema indicates the functional requirements of the enterprise (kinds of operations that will be performed on the data)
>
>>[!info]- Final phase
