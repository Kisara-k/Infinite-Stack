- Heading styles are used for headings 
- **Bold** text is used for key terms.
- _Italic_ text is used for emphasis.
- Times New Roman font is used for general text.
- Monospaced font is used for code snippets and system paths.
- Priorities for requirements are indicated using the following format:
	- **High**: Essential for initial release.
	- **Medium**: Important but not critical.
