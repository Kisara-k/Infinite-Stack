# 3. External Interface Requirements

## 3.1 User Interfaces  
The online banking system will provide a web-based user interface that allows users to perform various banking functions. The interface will adhere to modern web design principles, ensuring it is intuitive, responsive, and accessible. Key characteristics include:

- **Login/Registration Screens:** Secure login and account registration screens with standard input fields (username, password) and security measures like CAPTCHA and two-factor authentication.
- **Dashboard:** A central dashboard displaying account balances, recent transactions, and quick links to common actions such as transfers and bill payments.
- **Account Management:** Interfaces for viewing account details, managing account settings, and downloading statements.
- **Transaction Management:** Screens for initiating transfers, paying bills, and viewing transaction histories.
- **Notifications:** A section for displaying alerts, messages, and important notifications from the bank.
- **Help and Support:** Access to customer support via chat, email, or phone, with a help section that includes FAQs and guides.
- **Standard Buttons and Functions:** Consistent use of standard buttons like "Submit," "Cancel," and "Help" across all screens. Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., "Ctrl+T" for new transfer) will be provided.
- **Error Messages:** Clear and concise error messages will be displayed when users encounter issues.

## 3.2 Hardware Interfaces  
The web app will primarily interact with client devices such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. It will support modern web browsers on various operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Android, iOS). Key hardware interface characteristics include:

- **Device Compatibility:** The application will be compatible with devices having different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring responsive design and a consistent user experience.
- **Input Devices:** The app will support input via mouse, keyboard, touchscreens, and virtual keyboards.
- **Security Devices:** Integration with hardware security modules (HSMs) and secure elements for transactions requiring strong authentication (e.g., smart cards or biometric devices).

## 3.3 Software Interfaces  
The online banking system will interact with several software components, including:

- **Operating Systems:** Compatibility with popular operating systems like Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.
- **Databases:** Integration with secure databases for storing user data, transaction records, and account details. The system will use APIs to communicate with the database, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
- **Payment Gateways:** Interfaces to connect with third-party payment gateways for processing payments and transfers.
- **External APIs:** Interaction with external services like credit bureaus, KYC (Know Your Customer) verification services, and SMS/email notification services.
- **Web Servers:** The system will run on secure web servers, utilizing HTTPS for encrypted communication.
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** The application will leverage modern web development frameworks (e.g., React, Angular) and libraries (e.g., jQuery) for enhanced functionality and user experience.

## 3.4 Communications Interfaces  
The online banking system will require various communication functions to operate efficiently. These include:

- **Web Protocols:** The app will use HTTP/HTTPS for communication between client devices and the server. All data exchanges will be encrypted using SSL/TLS to ensure security.
- **Email and SMS Notifications:** The system will send transactional alerts, OTPs (One-Time Passwords), and other notifications via email and SMS. These communications will follow standard formats like SMTP for emails and SMS gateways for text messages.
- **API Communication:** The app will communicate with external APIs over RESTful services, using JSON or XML for data interchange. The APIs will be secured using OAuth or other authentication mechanisms.
- **Data Synchronization:** Real-time data synchronization will be implemented between the client and server, ensuring that user actions (e.g., initiating a transfer) are reflected instantly across all devices.
- **Security Protocols:** The system will use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest and in transit, and will adhere to industry standards like PCI DSS for handling payment information.
