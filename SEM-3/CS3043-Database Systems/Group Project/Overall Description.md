# 2.0 Overall Description

## 2.1 System Environment

The **Bank Transaction and Loan Processing System** is an advanced banking platform designed to replace the outdated DOS-based system currently in use by Bank A, a private bank in Seychelles. The primary goal of this new system is to modernize the bank's operations, ensure compliance with Seychelles' financial regulations, and lay the groundwork for future expansion, including integration with the national banking switch for cross-bank transactions and ATM services.

## 2.1.1 Deployment Architecture

The system will be deployed across all branches of Bank A, with the head office acting as the central hub. A secure **leased line network** will connect each branch to the head office, facilitating real-time communication and data transfer. The system's architecture will include:

- **Central Servers**: Located at the head office, these servers will host the core banking software, manage databases, and handle transaction processing.
- **Branch Terminals**: Bank employees will access the system through secure terminals at each branch, allowing for branch-level operations such as account management and loan processing.
- **Customer Portal**: Customers will interact with the system via an online portal, enabling them to manage their accounts, transfer funds, and apply for loans from anywhere.
- **Data Security Measures**: The system will incorporate robust security features, including encryption, secure login protocols, and regular audits, to protect sensitive banking data.

## 2.1.2 System Interfaces

The system will interact with several external and internal interfaces, including:

- **Banking Regulatory Systems**: Ensures compliance with national financial regulations through regular data exchanges.
- **Future Integration with National Banking Switch**: Although not included in the initial phase, the system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Seychelles national banking switch for cross-bank transactions and ATM operations.
- **Reporting Tools**: Provides secure access to reports generated by the system, available only to authorized personnel like branch managers.
