# 6. Other Requirements

## 6.1 Database Requirements

The database for the online banking system must be highly available, scalable, and secure. It should support ACID properties to ensure transaction integrity. The database must enforce strong data encryption both at rest and in transit, adhering to industry standards such as AES-256. Backup and recovery mechanisms should be in place to prevent data loss. 

## 6.2 Legal Requirements

The online banking system must comply with relevant financial regulations, including:

- **GDPR** for European users to protect personal data and privacy.
- **PCI DSS** for processing and storing payment card information.
- **Anti-Money Laundering laws** to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
- **KYC regulations** to verify the identity of customers.

All user data must be securely stored and handled according to these legal standards, and audit trails should be maintained for all transactions.
