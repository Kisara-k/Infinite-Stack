>[!FAQ]- What is **Computer Architecture**
>A blueprint that's visible to the programmer which contains key functional units, their interconnections, and instructions to program the `instruction set architecture`.
>- Ex :- x86, ARM

>[!FAQ]- What is **Computer Organization**
>The internal details of operational units, their interconnections, & control view of a computer designer.
>- Ex :- Intel & AMD both support x86 with different organizations

>[!FAQ]- What is **Computer Design**
>- It maps a given organization to a logic design, logic design to a silicon layout & chip packaging.
>- This is the view of the hardware designer.
>- Design decisions are based on constraints like circuit level delays, silicon real estate, heat generation & cost.
