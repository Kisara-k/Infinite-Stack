### Accessing Memory
- The **address bus** activates a memory cell at a particular location. This prepares the memory cell for read or write operation that will occur.
- The **control bus** specifies the action done on the particular activated memory location. Typically whether read or write action is performed.
- **Data bus** carries the relevant data to or from the memory cell depending on the control signal.

> [!tip]- Address bus & Control bus are unidirectional. The data bus can carry signals both ways but only in one direction at a time.
