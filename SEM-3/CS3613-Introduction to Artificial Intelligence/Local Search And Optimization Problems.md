# Local Search
> [!note] Characteristics of local search
> - It's a **Heuristic method**.
> - Use a *single current state* and move **only to neighbors**.
> - **No** track of *paths*
> - **No** track of the *set of states* that have been reached.
> - **Not systematic** :luc_tag: 
> 	- Might never explore a portion of the search space where the solution exists.

> [!tip] Advantages
> - **Use little space**.
> - Can find *reasonable solutions* in **large** or **infinite**(continuous) **state spaces** for which the *other algorithms are unsuitable*.

## Optimization
- **Local search** is often *suitable for* **optimization problems**.
- Search for the **best state** by optimizing an **objective function.**
- Moves from the **current state** to a **successor state**.
- A **successor** of state S is S with a **single element changed.**
- **Low memory requirements**, because the search tree or graph is not maintained in memory (*paths are not saved*).

> [!example]- Local search examples
> > [!info] 8-Queens Problem
> > Find a configuration of 8 queens on a chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. The state is represented by the positions of queens, and the search involves moving one queen at a time.

>  
> > [!info] Traveling Salesman Problem
> > Find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once. The state is the order of cities, and local search involves swapping the order of cities to find a shorter route.

## Comparison With Tree Search
> [!info] Tree Search ðŸ”Ž : 
>- Typically **doesn't** start with a complete configuration.
>- Has binary goal tests.
>- Saves paths.

> [!info] Local Search ðŸ”Ž :
> Starts with a complete configuration.
> Focuses on optimizing an objective function.
> **Does not** save **paths**.

## Visualization
- A one-dimensional state-space landscape in which elevation corresponds to the objective function. The aim is to find the global maximum
