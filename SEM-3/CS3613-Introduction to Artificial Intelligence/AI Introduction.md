## Acting humanly (The Turing test approach)

>[!note]- What is 'Turing test' ?
>
A method to evaluate the intelligence of a machine.
If a series of questions are answered by a human and a machine, when the interrogator can not distinguish between the responses, the machine is said to be intelligent. 

<br>

>[!note]- Drawbacks of the test
>- Doesn't really indicate if the machine has intelligence.
>- Mimicking human behavior doesn't make machines intelligence.
>- Human intelligence isn't the only form of intelligence.

#### Major components of AI
- Natural language processing (to communicate)
- Knowledge representation (to store what it learns)
- Automated reasoning (to answer Qs & draw new conclusions)
- Machine learning (to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns)
- Computer vision (to perceive the world)
- Robotics (for mobility)

## Thinking humanly (The cognitive modeling approach)

>[!note] What is Thinking humanly ?
>Machines that think like humans.
>For this a sufficiently precise theory of how the mind works is required.


>[!tip] Possible ways to achieve this is by
>- Introspection - catch your own thoughts as they go by
>- Psychological experiments - observe a person in action
>- brain imaging - observing the brain activity
>
>Then if the program's IO behavior matches corresponding human behavior it can be said that the machine thinks like a human. 

<br>

## Thinking Rationally (The "Law of Thought" approach)
>[!note] What is rational thinking?
>Ideal or correct way of reasoning or thinking.

>[!note] Drawbacks of this approach
> - Difficult to take informal knowledge and express it in a formal logical terms
> - Computationally intensive (Even a problem with a few dozen facts can exhaust any computer unless itâ€™s guided as to which reasoning steps to try first.)

<br>

## Acting Rationally (The rational agent approach)
>[!note] What is an Agent ?
>An entity that perceives and acts.

#### Computer agents are expected to
- Operate autonomously
- Perceive their environment
- Persist over a prolonged time period
- adapt to change
- Create and pursue goals 
 <br>

>[!note] What is a ***Rational agent*** ?
>An entity that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or when there is uncertainty, the best-expected outcome. 

#### Qualities of rational agents
- logical reasoning is one way of acting rationally (but there are other ways)
- Can be different from Acting human, because humans aren't always rational/logical.
- All the skills needed for the "Turing test" also allows an agent to act rationally. 
- AI has focused on the study and construction of agents that do the **right thing.**
- What counts as the **right thing** is defined by the objective that we provide to the agent.

<br>

>[!tip] Advantages of *rational agents*
>- More general than the "law of thought" approach
>- More amendable to scientific development



>[!note] What is Limited rationality ?
>The perfect rationality is not feasible in complex environments. The computational demands are too high.
>Hence partial rationality is used for ease of implementation
