## Problem Solving Agents
>[!abstract] Functionality of a **Problem-Solving Agent**
>Its an agent that plans ahead. It considers a sequence of actions that form a path to a goal.
>`Search` :  The computational process undertaken by a problem-solving agent.
>>[!example]- Search Algorithms
>>- Uninformed Algorithms
>>- Informed Algorithms

>[!info] Uses atomic representations

>[!warning] Can function only in the simplest environments
>- Episodic, single agent, fully observable, deterministic, static, and discrete.
